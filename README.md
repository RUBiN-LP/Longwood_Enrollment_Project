# Longwood_Enrollment_Project

For this project, I used Virginia provided data from four-year public universities to compare enrollment trends. Enrollment numbers from Longwood University was my primary focus when searching for trends. I used UVA and VCU data for comparison, as they are the two closest public universities to Longwood. I wanted to find out if enrollment was suffering region-wide, or just in central locations.
